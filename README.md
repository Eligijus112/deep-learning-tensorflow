# Deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras

A project to store all the notes and codes for my preparation for the tensorflow exam.

# Activating the virtual environment

For the creation of virtual environments (VE) anaconda is used. You can download anaconda here: 
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

After installing anaconda into your system follow the steps bellow to work in a virtual environment.

Creation of the VE:
```
conda create python=3.7 --name deep-tf
```

Activating the VE:
```
conda activate deep-tf
```

Installing all the packages from the **requirements.txt** file to the virtual environment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio code there may be some additional pop ups indiciating that some packages should be installed (linter or ikernel).
